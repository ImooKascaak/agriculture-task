This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Project Description

The purpose is to build a very simple single page hybrid web app. This page will include a dynamic histogram chart that will take values from the attached json file. This file includes 8 different agriculture tasks within an olive cultivation and statistics of co2 emissions for each task. We need the user to be able to see 4 different histograms for each kind of co2 emissions statistics (total, per acre, per olive oil ton, per olive oil kg) where each includes every cultivation task. The user will be able to select which histogram to render. You need to use one histogram that will dynamically draw values according to user selection, not multiple histograms.

The stack and the tools you should use are:

* react
* node.js
* node package manager
* d3.js

Additionally you are free to use any other package is suitable for your needs. We will evaluate the web version of the application.
